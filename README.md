# Subway Exit Map

![](https://github.com/k-yle/subway-exit-map/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

ðŸš‡ðŸ›— Some subway or train platforms only have an exit on one end of the platform, which means people might need to walk a long distance down the platform if they arrive in the wrong carriage.

This app uses [data from OpenStreetMap](https://osm.wiki/Key:exit:carriages) to show which carriage of a train is the closest to the exit when arriving at the station, to avoid a long walk down the platform to the exit or elevator.
